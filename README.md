AppleII-LibA2
=============

AppleII-LibA2 (formerly called LibA2, and still called that
informally) provides both end-user utilities and Perl library modules for
accessing files on Apple II ProDOS disk images for use with most Apple
II emulators.

This is a Git repository where development of LibA2 takes place.  For more information, visit [AppleII-LibA2 on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/AppleII-LibA2).
