=head1 NAME

pro_fmt - Create a blank Apple II ProDOS disk image file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pro_fmt> [options] I<FILE>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pro_fmt> creates blank ProDOS disk images.  The images are NOT
bootable, because they lack the necessary code in the boot blocks,
unless you use the "--boot-from" option to copy the boot blocks from a
bootable disk image.

Note that some emulators cannot deal with image files that are smaller
than their nominal size.  That is, they expect a 280 block disk image
file to be 143,360 bytes long.  Always use the "--extend" option when
creating image files for such emulators.

=head1 OPTIONS

 -b, --boot-from=FILE  Copy boot blocks from disk image FILE
 -e, --extend          Extend FILE to its maximum size
 -f, --force           Overwrite an existing file
 -d, --dos-order       Make a DOS 3.3-order image file
 -p, --prodos-order    Make a ProDOS-order image file
 -s, --size=BLOCKS     Make the image BLOCKS blocks in size
                         (default 280)
 -v, --volume=NAME     Use NAME for the ProDOS volume name
                         (default NEWDISK)
     --help            Display this help message
     --version         Display version information

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

B<pro_fmt> requires the modules AppleII::ProDOS and AppleII::Disk,
which are included with LibA2.
