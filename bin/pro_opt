=head1 NAME

pro_opt - Optimize an Apple II ProDOS disk image file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pro_opt> IMAGE-FILE OUTPUT-FILE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pro_opt> eliminates wasted space from a disk image file containing
an Apple II ProDOS volume.  It does this by creating a new disk image
file and copying all files from the old image to the new one.  Any
un-allocated blocks are eliminated from the new image file.

Note that some emulators cannot deal with image files that are smaller
than their nominal size.  That is, they expect a 280 block disk image
file to be 143,360 bytes long.  B<pro_opt> should not be used with
such emulators.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

B<pro_opt> requires the modules AppleII::ProDOS and AppleII::Disk,
which are included with LibA2.

=head1 BUGS

There are no known bugs, but you should keep a copy of your old image
file until you're sure the optimized image file works properly.
